##What is it?
It's a web version of my chrome extension Show Tracker. 
It contains even more features such as download link, subtitle DL link, etc. 
And it's created via node and express.

##How to run?
You'll need MongoDB for data storage purposes. Run Mongo first, then run  "node bin/www"

##Screenshots
Still a work in progress, but coming soon
