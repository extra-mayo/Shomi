##What is it?
It's a web version of my chrome extension Show Tracker. 
It contains even more features such as download link, subtitle DL link, automatic season and episode number update, etc. 
And it's created via node and express.

##How to run?

```javascript
npm install //for all the necessary modules
```

You'll need MongoDB for data storage purposes. 
Run Mongo, then run  
```javascript
node bin/www
```

Still a work in progress, but it's coming soon
