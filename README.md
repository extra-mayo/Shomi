##What is it?
It's a web version of my chrome extension Show Tracker. 
It contains even more features such as download link, subtitle DL link,  season and episode number, etc. 
Created via node and express.

##How to run?

```javascript
npm install //for all the necessary modules
```

You'll need MongoDB for data storage purposes. 
Run Mongo, then run  
```javascript
node bin/www
```

Still a work in progress, but it's coming soon
